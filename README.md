# Memorize
Memorize A SwiftUI-based memory game app, built as a study project following the curriculum of Stanford University's CS193p (Spring 2023): Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI.

About This Project
This repository is designed as a hands-on learning resource for anyone wanting to master iOS development with SwiftUI. It closely follows the assignments, demos, and best practices presented in Stanford's CS193p (Spring 2023) course. The app and its code are structured to help you understand key SwiftUI concepts, state management, and modern iOS development patterns.

Study Material
Lecture Screen Captures & Audio: While the Spring 2023 lectures were not video recorded, you can access screen captures and audio recordings of all presentations and demos here at [CS193p Course Website](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/).
Supporting Material: Homework, demo code, and additional resources distributed to students are also available at the above link.
Curriculum Note: The 2023 curriculum is very similar to the Spring 2021 version. If you’ve already studied the 2021 material, focus on Lecture 14 (actor-based async programming) for the most significant updates.
SwiftUI Update: With the release of Xcode 15/iOS 17, SwiftUI’s reactive UI mechanism has evolved. The new @Observable macro is now preferred over ObservableObject. This project uses the latest recommended patterns, but notes are included for backwards compatibility.
